Questions

1. What other tests would you suggest could be written? You do not need to write them out in details or code them.

			-> Test the single application type for residential investment purpose.
			-> Test the single/joint application with all available combination of dependents.
			-> Test the calculator by entering annual income as zero and leaving all other fields as zero and make sure error message is displayed.
			-> Test the calculator by entering credit card limit as zero and leaving all other fields as zero and make sure error message is displayed.
2. If this test was part of a much larger test set, how would you speed it up?

			-> We can perform parallel execution and speed up the test.
			
3. Sometimes UI tests can fail unpredictably. For example, the page may not have fully loaded before test automation attempts to click a button on a webpage. How would you improve reliability of these tests?

			-> we can get all the links available in webpage with help of selenium.
			-> And test those links with RestAssured for making sure their responses are not broken i.e. 4XX,5XX etc.
			-> Perform these test before starting UI test of webpage and proceed with the UI test only if links are not broken.
